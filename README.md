# Payment Integration

## 1st question: benefits and downsides of each integration solutions

### iFrame Integration
**Benefits:**
- PCI-compliant (card data never touches merchant servers)
- Seamless customer experience (appears as part of your site)
- Quick implementation

**Downsides:**
- Limited UI customization options
- Full dependency on PSP's availability
- Potential performance impact

### Client-Side Tokenization (CSE)
**Benefits:**
- Complete control over checkout design
- Reduced PCI compliance scope
- Faster processing (no redirects)

**Downsides:**
- More complex integration
- Requires proper form security measures

### Hosted Payment Page
**Benefits:**
- No PCI compliance requirements
- Automatic updates from PSP
- Supports multiple payment methods

**Downsides:**
- Poor user experience (redirect away from your site)
- Limited branding capabilities
- Higher abandonment rates

-------------------------------------------------------

## 3rd question: 3DS Authentication Implementation

### Potential Risks
- Network failures during redirect to/from bank's 3DS page
- Users abandoning the process mid-authentication
- 3DS page timeouts or server errors
- Transaction context loss on page refresh (mitigated via URL parameters)

### Current Solution
- **State Management**:  
  Uses URL parameters (`transactionId`, `returnUrl`) to maintain transaction continuity
- **Error Tracking**:  
  - RudderStack events for all redirect lifecycle stages  
  - Clear user-facing status messages for failures  
- **Production Considerations**:  
  - Sentry integration recommended for error logging  
  - Additional latency monitoring for 3DS steps  

### Success Metrics
| Metric | Measurement Method |
|--------|-------------------|
| Success Rate | `(Payment Completed events) / (3DS Redirect Initiated events)` |
| Drop-off Points | Funnel analysis between redirect stages |
| System Latency | Time delta between redirect start/complete events |
